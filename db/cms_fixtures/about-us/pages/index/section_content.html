<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<p>A world where decision makers in all sectors and at all levels recognise and take full account of the values of biodiversity as the bedrock of a global green economy and human well-being. We are concerned with multiple values of biodiversity, particularly where it is at risk, and the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem services which deliver human benefits.</p>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>To provide authoritative information about biodiversity and ecosystem services in a manner that is useful to decision-makers who are driving change in environment and development policy. We do this with partners worldwide by drawing together, analysing and interpreting information on biodiversity, as well as strengthening the ability of others to do so.</p>
