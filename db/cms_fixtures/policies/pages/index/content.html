<p>Our success hinges on our reputation for reliability and the degree of trust that our partners have in us. As the bedrock for building this trust, we make a commitment that our collaborative arrangements will be transparent, fair and equitable. We have a clear data policy which inter alia states that we will not assert any intellectual property rights in the data and information made available to us. Instead, we will take stringent measures to ensure that partners are correctly attributed and that the integrity of their contributions is preserved. Where we have long term relationships with academics or other exceptional individuals we encourage them to participate in the work of the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre as an honorary Fellow or Senior Fellow.</p>
