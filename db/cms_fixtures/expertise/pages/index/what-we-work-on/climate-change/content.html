<p>Climate change is putting increasing pressure on biodiversity and ecosystems, with knock-on effects on people who rely on them. As well as looking at the effects of climate change, our projects explore the ways in which biodiversity and ecosystem services can help communities adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects.</p>
<p>Through <a href="">projects with the UN-REDD Programme</a>, we work with developing countries to help governments identify, map and value the environmental benefits offered by international initiatives to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.</p>
<p>Other projects are producing tools to help decision-makers understand changes brought about by climate change and plan how to adapt to it. The <a href=''>Habitat Validation Tool</a> for example enables users to map and validate records of coastal vegetation such as mangroves to understand the distribution of this essential coastal resource, as well as calculate their carbon stock. </p>
