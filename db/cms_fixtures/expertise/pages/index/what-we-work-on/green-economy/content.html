<p>The green economy seeks improved human well-being and social equity, while also reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities. Our work underpins moves towards a green economy by allowing informed choices to be made about well-being, equity and environmental risk. The <a href="">UK National Ecosystem Assessment</a>, which was coordinated by UNEP-WCMC, evaluated the state of biodiversity and ecosystems in the UK, and gave us an idea of their monetary and non-monetary values. This work was taken up by the UK government and formed the basis of a White Paper on the environment.</p>
<p>With our substantial resources of data on the legal wildlife trade, gathered through decades of work with CITES trade authorities, we have developed methodologies to assess the economic value of the international trade in species listed in the CITES Appendices. This kind of information makes explicit the economic benefits of a sustainable wildlife trade as part of a regulated green economy.</p>
