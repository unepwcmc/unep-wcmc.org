<p>Protected areas are internationally recognised as regions set aside primarily for nature and biodiversity conservation and are a major tool in managing species and ecosystems which provide a range of goods and services essential to sustainable use of natural resources. The term 'protected area' includes Marine Protected Areas (MPA) the boundaries of which will include some area of ocean.</p>
<p>UNEP-WCMC develops and supports the scientific basis for the valuation of protected areas, assesses the management and ecological effectiveness of these areas, and monitors this performance at a global level. Our featured project is <a href"">Protected Planet</a>, a tool that allows us to manage the World Database on Protected Areas and make this information available.</p>
<p>We provide support for protected area networks, such as World Heritage Sites and Indigenous and Community Conserved Areas, and work on ensuring the long-term sustainability of protected areas.</p>
