<p>We focus on four major thematic areas that reflect current key issues in biodiversity management: climate change, the green economy, ecosystem services and protected areas. Many projects work across thematic areas: for example, the Protected Areas Resilient to Climate Change (PARCC) project managed by UNEP-WCMC spans climate change and protected areas.</p>
<p>Across the Centre we approach the thematic areas from widely differing angles. Ecosystem services, for instance, is an integral part of more than 18 projects in 2013, which look ways of measuring, assessing, valuing, communicating, mapping, and using ecosystem services in policy at scales that range from single sites to global levels.</p>
