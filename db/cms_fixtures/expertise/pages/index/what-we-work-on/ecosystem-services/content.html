<p>We rely on services provided by the environment in all areas of our lives â€“ from pollination of crops by a multitude of insect species, to regulation of water flows and quality. Yet our understanding of the importance of these services, the interactions between them and the impact of human activities on them, is often limited.</p>
<p>Understanding, quantifying and valuing ecosystem services is a theme that runs through many of our projects. The Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment (TESSA) is a product of collaboration between UNEP-WCMC and 14 other conservation organisations. It guides non-specialists to identify the ecosystem services that are important at a particular site, evaluate the benefits that people get from them, and compare that with alternative land uses. At a different scale, with funding from the <a ref="">MacArthur Foundation</a> we are using a high-resolution model of land use change to assess the trade-offs between agricultural development and biodiversity at national and regional scales, using accepted global scenarios of change between 2000 and 2050.</p>
