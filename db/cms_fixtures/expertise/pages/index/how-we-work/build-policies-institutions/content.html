<p>The way in which governments, intergovernmental organisations and businesses manage biodiversity is governed by their policies and institutions. We help our partners at all levels to understand the effects that their policies have on biodiversity, and how to build strong policy and institutional frameworks to manage the environment effectively. We work, for example, with the secretariats of several multilateral environmental agreements to minimise overlaps and conflicts between them and have provided on-going support and advice to the newly formed <a href="">International Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)</a>.</p>
