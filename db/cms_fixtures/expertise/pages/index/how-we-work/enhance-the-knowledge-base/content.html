<h2>The issue</h2>
<p>Good decisions are based on sound knowledge. Decision makers need to understand the state of the environment, the drivers of environmental change, and global responses to change. But national datasets are fragmented and disparate, and don&rsquo;t always allow ready comparison.</p>
<h2>Our approach</h2>
<p>At UNEP-WCMC we work with our partners around the world to bring together, manage and keep updated several critically important global datasets related to biodiversity. Our partners help us compile national data in standard formats to form a global information resource.</p>
<h2>Our projects</h2>
<p>The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the world&rsquo;s most comprehensive database on terrestrial and marine protected areas. It is just one of the major databases managed by UNEP-WCMC. Spatial data from governments and non-governmental organizations are regularly updated and made available via the online interface, <a href="http://protectedplanet.net/">Protected Planet</a>. Managed in partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature&rsquo;s World Commission on Protected Areas, the WDPA contains approximately 200,000 records. This comprehensive resource has made it easier to set, and assess progress towards, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.</p>
