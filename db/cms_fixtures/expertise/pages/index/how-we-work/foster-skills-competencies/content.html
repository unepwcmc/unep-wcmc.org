<p>Good environmental management relies on people who have the right skills for their jobs. We train people to use the right tools and methods to manage biodiversity better. For example, through the <a href="">Biodiversity Indicators Partnership</a> we train people from many countries to develop indicators to measure and report on changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services at the national, regional and international levels. </p>
